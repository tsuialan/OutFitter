# Outfitters

Created by Alan Tsui, Edmond Choi, and Steven Gov

What is it?
------------
Outfitters is an online website that employs AI tech to recommend outfits for the user tailored to their personality.

How we built it
----------------
Our team employed CSS and HTML to create a visually stuning front-end website. As for the backend, it would not have been
possible without the Use of Amazon Web Service (AWS) for the login and the user storage system to store profiles and outfits.
We also used Google Vision for its amazing visual AI recognition to support our outfit suggestions. 

Challenges we ran into
-----------------------
- Learning how to easily include Google vision and AWS APIs
- Understanding the fundamentals of back-end deign
- Unfamiliarity with front-end design of web pages (CSS)
- Setting up a live website for our users.

Accomplishments that we are proud of
-------------------------------------
- Seamlessly integrating the APIs (Google vision, AWS) into our web app
- Detailed and visually appealing front-end design
- Better understanding in the back-end aspects of web apps

What's next for OutFitters
---------------------------
Albeit being a bit rough, OutFitters is looking to implement a plethora of more features such as price checks to return the
lowest priced item, built-in coupon code checkers, and even possible partners with suppliers and have its own personally
tailored outfits for customers
